# Hi guys, I'm JoÃ£o Lucas ðŸ˜€
My name is JoÃ£o Lucas. I am passionate about technology and enjoy studying and discovering new things. I have a good sense of humor, like facing new challenges, and prefer working in groups. In 2021, I was accepted to FATEC in the 1st colocation. Among my certifications is the TOEIC, making me the first Brazilian with cerebral palsy to achieve this.
